# BiblePlanner

BiblePlanner is a daily Bible reading planner. The user must enter the indexes of the Bible books to be read, and the start and end dates.

The program will attempt to assign a consistent length of reading per day, based on the length of the individual chapters. Catch-up days may be included.

The user may select a length flag to include the length (character count) of the reading each day.
