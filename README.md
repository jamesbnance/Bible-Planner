# BiblePlanner

BiblePlanner is a Bible reading planner. The user enters the Bible books to be read and the start and end dates. The program will attempt to assign a consistent length of reading per day. If the number of chapters cannot be equally distributed throughout the dates for that book, one extra chapter is read at the beginning of the book. Catch-up days may be included.
